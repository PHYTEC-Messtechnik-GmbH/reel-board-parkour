This repository provides sample applications for the reel board.
reel board is an evaluation board based on the Nordic Semiconductor
nRF52840 SoC with an integrated 2.4 GHz transceiver supporting
different communication standards. The board was developed by PHYTEC
in cooperation with Zephyr Project.

The Zephyr Project is a scalable real-time operating system (RTOS) supporting
multiple hardware architectures, optimized for resource constrained devices,
and built with security in mind.
